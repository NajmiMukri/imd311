<h1>Hobby</h1>
<p>Welcome to my hobby page! I'm passionate about a variety of interests that add color to my life. Here's a glimpse into what I love to do:</p>
<h3>RPG (Role-Playing Games)</h3>
<p>From embarking on epic quests to creating and playing unique characters, RPGs have always fascinated me. Some of my favorite RPGs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="image/game1.jpg" alt="Dragon Quest V Image" width="30%" height="30%" border="2">
<p>
<strong>Review:</strong> Dragon Quest V offers a generational storytelling adds a rich layer to the narrative, allowing players to witness the protagonist's journey from childhood to parenthood. This is the first ever game that i played that use generational storytelling. The game also use emotional storytelling explores themes of family, love, and sacrifice, creating a narrative that really resonates with me on a personal level. Whenever I replay the game, I always choose the same bride for the protagonist. Although I occasionally opt for other characters for a different experience, my heart still belongs to the same one. P.S. Debora for life.

<strong>Genshin Impact</strong>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<strong>Review:</strong> Genshin Impact offers a visually stunning open-world RPG that seamlessly combines exploration with dynamic combat. With its anime-inspired art style, engaging elemental system, and a rich cast of characters, the game provides an immersive experience. The gacha system adds excitement, while regular updates keep the content fresh. "Genshin Impact" stands out as a captivating and accessible game that has taken the gaming world by storm. I play this game because of its connection to anime and its open-world game, allowing me to explore every corner of the game.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Honkai Star Rail</strong>
<br>
<br>

<p>
<strong>Review:</strong> Hoyoverse, the studio behind Genshin Impact, introduces Honkai: Star Rail, a captivating turn-based RPG set in a space fantasy universe. Unlike Genshin Impact, this game offers strategic battles and a semi-open world for exploration. While lacking multiplayer features, the gacha mechanics and character development make it an engaging experience. Free-to-play with in-game purchases, Honkai: Star Rail quickly becomes a favorite, combining thrilling gameplay with the excitement of character pulls and exploration. The game also offers autoplay in combat, which really helps me farm materials for characters while doing other things, like assignments.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manga and Anime</h3>
<p>As an avid reader of manga/manhwa and a fan of anime, I'm constantly discovering new worlds and characters. Some of my top picks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Solo Leveling</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="image/manhwa.png" alt="Solo Leveling Image" width="20%" height="20%" border="2">
<p>
<strong>Review:</strong> "Solo Leveling" follows Sung Jin-Woo's evolution from the weakest hunter to the most powerful. Its compelling narrative, well-crafted characters, and impressive artwork make it a must-read for fans of action and fantasy. The series captivates readers with intense action scenes, strategic character development, and a unique mix of supernatural elements.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ReLIFE</strong>
<br>
<br>
<img src="image/anime.jpg" alt="ReLIFE Image" width="20%" height="20%" border="2">
<p>
<strong>Review:</strong> "ReLIFE" is a heartwarming anime that explores the theme of second chances. Arata Kaizaki, a 27-year-old unemployed man, is given an opportunity to relive his high school life as part of a mysterious experiment. The series beautifully blends comedy, drama, and romance as it delves into themes of self-discovery, friendship, and personal growth.
What's notable is that "ReLIFE" also exists as a manga, offering a more in-depth exploration of the story. The manga complements the anime, providing additional details and character insights. Personally, I thoroughly enjoy both reading and watching "ReLIFE," as it offers a unique and emotionally resonant experience.
